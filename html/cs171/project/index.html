            <p>This page takes a deep dive into the possibilities and options of electric vehicle usage in the US. That means it gives a general overview about electric vehicle technologies and how the environment can benefit from using it.</p>

            <p>The goal is to increase your knowledge about this topic and to guide you through the various aspects. The aim is to help you forming an opinion about this new technology.</p>

                    Over their lifetime, battery electric vehicles produce far less global warming pollution than their gasoline counterparts and they’re getting cleaner.

            </div>

            <p>Electric cars and trucks are powered by electricity, which as an energy source is cleaner and cheaper than oil. Electric vehicles are also practical: According to the Union of Concerned Scientist 4 out of 10 U.S. households could use a battery-electric or plug-in electric vehicle, and all households could use a hybrid-electric vehicle. Doing so would save drivers billions in fuel costs and greatly reduce the amount of global warming pollution we emit.</p>

            <h2>What types of electric vehicles exist?</h2>

            <p>A <strong>hybrid electric vehicle (HEV)</strong> is a type of hybrid vehicle and electric vehicle that combines a conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) propulsion system with an electric propulsion system. The presence of the electric powertrain is intended to achieve either better fuel economy than a conventional vehicle or better performance.

            </p>

            <p>A <strong>plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV)</strong>, also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid electric vehicle with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A PHEV shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle, having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine; and of an all-electric vehicle, also having a plug to connect to the electrical grid. PHEVs have a much larger all-electric range as compared to conventional gasoline-electric hybrids, and also eliminate the "range anxiety" associated with all-electric vehicles, because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted.
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_electric_vehicle#Plug-in_hybrids_.28PHEVs.29">(Learn more ...)</a> </p>

            <p>An <strong>all-electric vehicle, battery electric vehicle (BEV)</strong> or <strong>battery-only electric vehicle (BOEV)</strong> is a type of electric vehicle (EV) that uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs. BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, fuel cell, or fuel tank.
